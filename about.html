                <h2>Her Story</h2>
                <p>I found Proxy three years ago on a rainy autumn evening. She was huddled beneath the porch of my apartment building, a tiny ball of damp fur with cautious eyes. Despite her initial reluctance, something about her independent spirit called to me.</p>
                <p>After some coaxing with treats and patience, she allowed me to bring her inside. The vet estimated she was about a year old at the time. From that day forward, we've been inseparable companions - though she'd never admit it.</p>

                <h2>Her Personality</h2>
                <p>Proxy is the definition of a cat with attitude. She has her routines and preferences, and heaven help anyone who tries to disrupt them. Her favorite spot is on the windowsill in the afternoon sun, where she can watch birds and judge passersby with equal disdain.</p>
                <p>Despite her stubborn nature, she shows affection in her own subtle ways - sleeping at the foot of my bed, bringing me "gifts" (usually hair ties), and occasionally gracing me with a purring session when the mood strikes her.</p>

                <h2>Her Health Journey</h2>
                <p>About two months ago, I noticed Proxy was grooming her belly excessively. Soon after, small patches of fur began to thin. Initially, I thought it might be seasonal shedding, but it quickly became apparent this was something more concerning.</p>
                <p>Our local vet has diagnosed it as potential allergic dermatitis, but we need to see a feline dermatology specialist to confirm and create a proper treatment plan. The specialist visits, tests, and medications will be costly, but Proxy deserves the best care possible.</p>
                <p>This website is my way of reaching out to fellow cat lovers who understand the special bond we share with our feline friends and might be willing to help Proxy get the care she needs.</p>
