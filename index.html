                <p>A stubborn cat that is quite lazy and doesn't like too much affection but is a good companion of mine. She tends to keep to herself, finding comfort in quiet corners of my home where she can observe the world with her knowing eyes.</p>
                <p>Despite her independent nature, Proxy has been by my side through thick and thin, offering the kind of silent companionship that speaks volumes without saying a word.</p>

                <h2>Her Struggle</h2>
                <p>Recently, Proxy has been facing a serious health condition - she's been experiencing significant balding on her belly. What started as a small patch has grown concerning over the past few months.</p>
                <p>The veterinarian suggests it might be due to a combination of stress and possible allergies, but further testing and specialized treatment are needed to fully address her condition and bring back her beautiful fur.</p>
